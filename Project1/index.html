                <h2>Missile Man Of India</h2>
                <p>
                    <b> Abdul Pakir Jainulabdeen Abdul Kalam</b> was born on 15 October 1931, to a
                    Tamil Muslim family in the pilgrimage centre of Rameswaram on Pamban Island,
                    then in the Madras Presidency and now in the State of Tamil Nadu. His
                    father Jainulabdeen Marakayar was a boat owner and imam of a
                    local mosque;[10] his mother Ashiamma was a housewife. His father owned
                    a ferry that took Hindu pilgrims back and forth between Rameswaram and
                    the now uninhabited Dhanushkod.
                    Kalam was the youngest of four brothers and one sister in his family.
                    His ancestors had been wealthy Marakayar traders and landowners, with numerous
                    properties and large tracts of land. Marakayar are a Muslim ethnic group found in
                    coastal Tamil Nadu and Sri Lanka who claim descent from Arab traders and local women.
